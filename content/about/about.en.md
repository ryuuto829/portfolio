Hi, I'm Dmytro, a Front-End Web Developer and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet, whether that be websites, applications, or anything in between.

My goal is to always build things that provide user-focused interfaces and good user experiences. I love building modern applications for devices of all sizes on the web.

I'm always trying to grow and learn something new. I lose track of time when I'm studying languages, reading a book, and producing music.
