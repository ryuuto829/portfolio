Hello! I'm Dmytro, a software engineer based in ..

I enjoy creating things that live on the internet, whether that be websites, applications, or anything in between. My goal is to always build products that provide pixel-perfect, performant experiences.

Shortly after graduating from University, I joined the engineering team at where I work on a wide variety of interesting and meaningful projects on a daily basis.

Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:

- JavaScript (ES6+)
- React
- HTML, (S)CSS
- Node.js
- Gatsby
- Typescript
